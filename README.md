How is this going to work ?

let me tell you.
1.git copy (your repo)
2.git commit -m "yourmessage"
3.git push
4.git copy if you closed visual Studio
5.git chekout -b for a new branch, name it what you want
6.git branch to see which branch you are on.
7.git checkout(branch name) if you want to switch between branches.
8.Once modified a file, git add to let git see the changes,then commit,then push.
