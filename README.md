How is this going to work ?

let me tell you.
1.git copy (your repo)
2.git commit -m "yourmessage"
3.git push
4.git copy if you closed visual Studio
5.git chekout -b for a new branch, name it what you want
6.git branch to see which branch you are on.
7.git checkout(branch name) if you want to switch between branches.
8.Once modified a file, git add to let git see the changes,then commit,then push.

## extra
git branch -d(branch name or link) for deleting a branch inside your code.
git commit -am for adding the repo and to commit a messagge(ONLY FOR MODIFIED FILES).
git reset to reset your repo but to reset a commit you also type HEAD. To reset a commit before the last commit you type git reset HEAD~1 so it resets the commit before the last commit.
git log to see your log.
you can reset a commit saved in a log so ,git reset (log commit number in git log).
to remove latest updates just type git remove --hard(log commit number in git log.) 
you can if you want to have acess to a repo(not yours) fork it in github and change it or not.
